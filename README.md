# ðŸ”Š Play sounds while and after shell jobs complete

`onhold` is a command-line utility that allows you to play music while a long job completes.

[`ding`](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/ding) is command-line utility that will play a sound after a long job completes.

Both utilities will take data that is piped into their standard inputs and pipe it to standard output. That is to say that data piped into `onhold` and [`ding`](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/ding) will be piped right back out.

```bash
$ echo "Hello!" | onhold
Hello!
```

As a result, you can build pipelines with `onhold` and [`ding`](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/ding).

For example, you can download an ISO with [`http`](https://httpie.org/), visualize the progress with [`pv`](http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml), play music with `onhold` while writing to `/dev/null`, and when it's finished, play a sound with [`ding`](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/ding).

```bash
$ export URL="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.1/ubuntu-20.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso"
$ http "$URL" | pv | onhold | ding > /dev/null
```

This project uses [`play_sounds`](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/play_sounds), a wrapper over [`playsound`](https://pypi.org/project/playsound/) and [`boombox`](https://pypi.org/project/boombox/).

## `onhold`

You can either set the `$ONHOLD` environment variable to the song you'd like to play, or supply the song with the `-s` flag.

```bash
$ export ONHOLD="~/Music/song.mp3"
$ pv /dev/zero | onhold > /dev/null
```

This allows you to set `$ONHOLD` in your `~/.bashrc`.

You can also specify it with a flag.

```bash
$ pv /dev/zero | onhold -s song.mp3 > /dev/null
```

`onhold` comes with a default song that will play if neither `$ONHOLD` or `-s` are set. You can use the `-w` flag to show warnings if `$ONHOLD` or `-s` are not set.

```bash
$ echo "Hello!" | onhold
Hello!
```

## [`ding`](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/ding)

You can either set the `$DING` environment variable to the sound you'd like to play, or supply the sound with the `-s` flag.

```bash
# You can run ding after a command or as part of a pipeline
$ export DING="~/Music/ding.ogg"
$ sleep 5; ding
$ echo "Hello!" | ding
Hello!
```

This allows you to set `$DING` in your `~/.bashrc`.

You can also specify it with a flag.

```bash
$ echo "Hello!" | ding -s ding.ogg
Hello!
```

[`ding`](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/ding) comes with a default sound that will play if neither `$DING` or `-s` are set. You can use the `-w` flag to show warnings if `$DING` or `-s` are not set.

```bash
$ echo "Hello!" | ding
Hello!
```

### [`ding`](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/ding) is its own package, too
You can install [`ding`](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/ding) by itself. Future versions of `onhold` will not ship with [`ding`](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/ding). [Click here to visit `ding`'s project page with installation instructions.](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/ding)
